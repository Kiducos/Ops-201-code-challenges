# My Repo

### What is this repo all about?
- In this repo, you can follow the progression of new skills I am cultivating to kickstart my aspiring career as a cybersecurity analyst.  Inside, you will find commitments that attribute to furthering my knowledge using bash and powershell.   

### Why are you learning these skills?
- As an aspiring cybersecurity analyst, being comfortable with fundamental IT concepts and languages is important. As I learn these skills, I gain a better understanding of how to communicate with computers as well as what they are capable of.   

### What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
- While attending Ops 201, I have gotten very comfortable with identifying and troubleshooting common errors you may face when working with Windows operating systems. Other fundamental concepts would include an in depth dive into PC settings and how they can be configured for accomadating user needs.  

### What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
- My favoirte Ops Challenge was the assignment that included using bash conditionals to make a script that detects if a file or directory exists, then creates it if it does not exist.  I thought this Ops Challenge was fun to put together and showed a good demonstration of what scripts can be used for when automating commands.  Learning about condtionals during this assignment help me gain a better understanding of how to write and format scripts to get a desired outcome. 

### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
- With a variety of operating sytems being used by different companies, I believe being comfortable with multiple shell scripting languages is a versitile skill to have in the long run.  With these scripting examples, I can apply a number of different methods on how to perform tasks to assist future companies with their needs. 

### What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
- In Ops 201, I enjoyed working on conditional scripts but if I had time to improve and personalize a script, it would be the script to automate endpoint configuration using powershell.  I thought it was a useful script to learn about as it would make configuring settings an easier task when working with future VM's with the same operating system. 

### What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
- As I continue to learn about shell scripts, I would like to improve my knowledge on how to manage and configure settings from the command line to create an efficient and dependable machine.
